  abstract = {Varied-intensity work intervals have been shown to induce higher fractions of maximal oxygen uptake during high-intensity interval training compared with constant-intensity work intervals. We assessed whether varied-intensity work intervals combined with intermittent vibration could further increase cyclists' fraction of maximal oxygen uptake to potentially optimise adaptive stimulus. Thirteen cyclists ({\.V}O2max: 69.7{\textpm}7.1\,ml{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}min-1) underwent a performance assessment and two high-intensity interval training sessions. Both comprised six 5-minute varied-intensity work intervals within which the work rate was alternated between 100\% (3{\texttimes}30-second blocks, with or without vibration) and 77\% of maximal aerobic power (always without vibration). Adding vibration to varied-intensity work intervals did not elicit a longer time above ninety percent of maximal oxygen uptake (415{\textpm}221 versus 399{\textpm}209\,seconds, P=0.69). Heart rate- and perceptual-based training-load metrics were also not affected (all P{$\geq$}0.59). When considering individual work intervals, no between-condition differences were found (fraction of maximal oxygen uptake, P=0.34; total oxygen uptake, P=0.053; mean minute ventilation, P=0.079; mean heart rate, P=0.88; blood lactate concentration, P=0.53; ratings of perceived exertion, P=0.29). Adding intermittent vibration to varied-intensity work intervals does not increase the fraction of maximal oxygen uptake elicited. Whether intermittent exposure to vibration can enhance cyclists' adaptive stimulus triggered by high-intensity interval training remains to be determined.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Maximal oxygen uptake ( V˙O2max) is a key determinant of endurance performance. Therefore, devising high-intensity interval training (HIIT) that maximizes stress of the oxygen-transport and -utilization systems may be important to stimulate further adaptation in athletes. The authors compared physiological and perceptual responses elicited by work intervals matched for duration and mean power output but differing in power-output distribution. Methods: Fourteen cyclists ( V˙O2max 69.2 [6.6] mL{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}min-1) completed 3 laboratory visits for a performance assessment and 2 HIIT sessions using either varied-intensity or constant-intensity work intervals. Results: Cyclists spent more time at {$>$}90\%V˙O2max during HIIT with varied-intensity work intervals (410 [207] vs 286 [162] s, P\,=\,.02), but there were no differences between sessions in heart-rate- or perceptual-based training-load metrics (all P\,{$\geq$}\,.1). When considering individual work intervals, minute ventilation ( V˙E) was higher in the varied-intensity mode (F\,=\,8.42, P\,=\,.01), but not respiratory frequency, tidal volume, blood lactate concentration [La], ratings of perceived exertion, or cadence (all F\,{$\leq$}\,3.50,\,{$\geq$}\,.08). Absolute changes ({$\Delta$}) between HIIT sessions were calculated per work interval, and {$\Delta$} total oxygen uptake was moderately associated with {$\Delta$}V˙E (r\,=\,.36, P\,=\,.002). Conclusions: In comparison with an HIIT session with constant-intensity work intervals, well-trained cyclists sustain higher fractions of V˙O2max when work intervals involved power-output variations. This effect is partially mediated by an increased oxygen cost of hyperpnea and not associated with a higher [La], perceived exertion, or training-load metrics.},

In many fields, including sport and exercise science, exploratory research is not openly reported, a practice that leads to serious problems. At the same time, exploration is a crucial step in scientific knowledge generation, and a substantial proportion of studies will be exploratory in nature, or include both confirmatory and exploratory analyses. Using a flowchart, we review how data are typically collected and used, and we distinguish exploratory from confirmatory studies by arguing that data-driven analyses, where the Type I and Type II error cannot be controlled, is what characterises exploratory research. We ask which factors increase the quality and value of exploratory analyses, and highlight large sample sizes, uncommon sample compositions, rigorous data collection, widely used measures, observing a logical and coherent pattern across multiple variables, and the potential for generating new research questions as the main factors. Finally, we provide guidelines for carrying out and transparently writing up an exploratory study.},

  abstract = {Negative or evenly paced racing strategies often lead to more favorable performance outcomes for endurance athletes. However, casual inspection of race split times and observational studies both indicate that elite triathletes competing in Olympic-distance triathlon typically implement a positive pacing strategy during the last of the 3 disciplines, the 10-km run. To address this apparent contradiction, the authors examined data from 14 International Triathlon Union elite races over 3 consecutive years involving a total of 725 male athletes. Analyses of race results confirm that triathletes typically implement a positive running pace strategy, running the first lap of the standard 4-lap circuit substantially faster than laps 2 ({$\sim$}7\%), 3 ({$\sim$}9\%), and 4 ({$\sim$}12\%). Interestingly, mean running pace in lap 1 had a substantially lower correlation with 10-km run time (r\,=\,.82) than both laps 2 and 3. Overall triathlon race performance (ranking) was best associated with run performance (r\,=\,.82) compared with the swim and cycle sections. Lower variability in race pace during the 10-km run was also reflective of more successful run times. Given that overall race outcome is mainly explained by the 10-km run performance, with top run performances associated with a more evenly paced strategy, triathletes (and their coaches) should reevaluate their pacing strategy during the run section.},

  abstract = {It has often been reported that mental exertion, presumably leading to mental fatigue, can negatively affect exercise performance; however, recent findings have questioned the strength of the effect. To further complicate this issue, an overlooked problem might be the presence of publication bias in studies using underpowered designs, which is known to inflate false positive report probability and effect size estimates. Altogether, the presence of bias is likely to reduce the evidential value of the published literature on this topic, although it is unknown to what extent. The purpose of the current work was to assess the evidential value of studies published to date on the effect of mental exertion on exercise performance by assessing the presence of publication bias and the observed statistical power achieved by these studies. A traditional meta-analysis revealed a Cohen's dz effect size of -\,0.54, 95\% CI [-\,0.68, -\,0.40], p\,{$<$}\,.001. However, when we applied methods for estimating and correcting for publication bias (based on funnel plot asymmetry and observed p-values), we found that the bias-corrected effect size became negligible with most of publication-bias methods and decreased to -\,0.36 in the more optimistic of all the scenarios. A robust Bayesian meta-analysis found strong evidence in favor of publication bias, BFpb\,{$>$}\,1000, and inconclusive evidence in favor of the effect, adjusted dz\,=\,0.01, 95\% CrI [-\,0.46, 0.37], BF10\,=\,0.90. Furthermore, the median observed statistical power assuming the unadjusted meta-analytic effect size (i.e., -\,0.54) as the true effect size was 39\% (min\,=\,19\%, max\,=\,96\%), indicating that, on average, these studies only had a 39\% chance of observing a significant result if the true effect was Cohen's dz\,=\,-\,0.54. If the more optimistic adjusted effect size (-\,0.36) was assumed as the true effect, the median statistical power was just 20\%. We conclude that the current literature is a useful case study for illustrating the dangers of conducting underpowered studies to detect the effect size of interest.},

While these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a study (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that these statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the meaningful interpretation of results. Type S errors are a response to the criticism of testing against a point null of exactly zero in contexts where true zero effects are implausible. Testing against a minimum-effect, while controlling the Type 1 error rate, provides a more coherent and practically useful alternative. Type M errors warn against effect size inflation after selectively reporting significant results, but we argue that statistical indices such as the critical effect size or bias adjusted effect size are preferable approaches. We do believe that Type S and M errors can be valuable in statistics education where the principles of error control are explained, and in the discussion section of studies that fail to follow good research practices. Overall, we argue their use-cases are more limited than is currently recognized, and alternative solutions deserve greater attention.},

One way to ensure that studies have adequate statistical power to detect the effect size of interest is by conducting a-priori power analyses. Yet, a previous editorial published in the Journal of Sports Sciences reported a median sample size of 19 and the scarce usage of a-priori power analyses. We meta-analysed 89 studies from the same journal to assess the presence and extent of publication bias, as well as the average statistical power, by conducting a z-curve analysis. In a larger sample of 174 studies, we also examined a) the usage, reporting practices and reproducibility of a-priori power analyses; and b) the prevalence of reporting practices of t-statistic or F-ratio, degrees of freedom, exact p-values, effect sizes and confidence intervals. Our results indicate that there was some indication of publication bias and the average observed power was low (53\% for significant and non-significant findings and 61\% for only significant findings). Finally, the usage and reporting practices of a-priori power analyses as well as statistical results including test statistics, effect sizes and confidence intervals were suboptimal.},

Large replication projects in psychology and cancer biology have evaluated the replicability of their fields but no collaborative effort has been undertaken in sports and exercise science. We propose to undertake such an effort here. As this is the first large replication project in this field, there is no agreed-upon protocol for selecting studies to replicate. Criticism of previous selection protocols include claims they were non-randomised and non-representative. Any selection protocol in sports and exercise science must be representative to provide an accurate estimate of replicability of the field. Our aim is to produce a protocol for selecting studies to replicate for inclusion in a large replication project in sports and exercise science. METHODS: The proposed selection protocol uses multiple inclusion and exclusion criteria for replication study selection, including: the year of publication and citation rankings, research disciplines, study types, the research question and key dependent variable, study methods and feasibility. Studies selected for replication will be stratified into pools based on instrumentation and expertise required, and will then be allocated to volunteer laboratories for replication. Replication outcomes will be assessed using a multiple inferential strategy and descriptive information will be reported regarding the final number of included and excluded studies, and original author responses to requests for raw data.},

  abstract = {There are formal calls for increased reproducibility and replicability in sports and exercise science, yet there is minimal information on the overall knowledge of these concepts at a field-wide level. Therefore, we conducted a survey on the attitudes and perceptions of sports and exercise science researchers towards reproducibility and replicability. Descriptive statistics (e.g., proportion of responses), and thematic analysis, were utilized to characterize the responses. Of the 511 respondents, 42\% (n = 217) believe there is a significant crisis of reproducibility or replicability in sports and exercise science while 36\% (n = 182) believe there is a slight crisis. 3\% (n = 15) of respondents believe there is no crisis while 19\% (n = 95) did not know. Four themes were generated in the thematic analysis: the research and publishing culture, educational barriers to research integrity, research responsibility to ensure reproducibility and replicability, and current practices facilitating reproducibility and replicability. Researchers believe that engaging in open science can be detrimental to career opportunities due to lack of incentives. They also feel journals are a barrier to reproducible and replicable research due to high publication charges and a focus on novelty. Statistical expertise was identified as a key factor for improving reproducibility and replicability in the future, particularly, a better understanding of study design and different statistical techniques. Statistical education should be prioritised for early career researchers which could positively affect publication and peer review. Researchers must accept responsibility for reproducibility and replicability with thorough project design, appropriate planning of analyses, and transparent reporting practices.},
