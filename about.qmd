I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at Eindhoven University of Technology, where I do meta-science and teach quantitative research methods in psychology. My current work involves working with DaniÃ«l Lakens and Lisa Debruine on [**Papercheck**](https://scienceverse.github.io/papercheck/), an R package designed to assist researchers in preventing common errors, enforcing best research practices, and extracting data from published studies.
