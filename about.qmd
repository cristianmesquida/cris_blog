Soon I will be submitting my PhD thesis which focused on the replicability and reproducibility of sports and exercise science research. I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at Eindhoven University of Technology, where I do meta-science. My current work involves working with DaniÃ«l Lakens and Lisa Debruine on [**Papercheck**](https://scienceverse.github.io/papercheck/), an R package designed to assist researchers in preventing common errors, enforcing best research practices, and extracting data from published studies. In the upcoming academic year, I will be teaching quantitative research methods in psychology.
