I defended my [PhD](https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/an-investigation-into-the-barriers-to-replicability-and-reproduci/) on January 8th, with a dissertation examining the replicability and reproducibility of research in sports and exercise science. I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Eindhoven University of Technology, where I conduct meta-science research. My current work focuses on [**Metacheck**](https://scienceverse.github.io/papercheck/), an R package designed to help researchers prevent common statistical and reporting errors, promote best research practices, and extract data from published studies. I collaborate on this project with Daniël Lakens and Lisa DeBruine. My main responsibility is the development of the power analysis module and the validation of all Metacheck modules.
In addition to my research, I teach quantitative research methods, including multiple regression, power analysis, and meta-analysis.
