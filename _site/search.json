I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at Eindhoven University of Technology, where I do meta-science and teach quantitative research methods in psychology. My current work involves working with Daniël Lakens and Lisa Debruine on Papercheck, an R package designed to assist researchers in preventing common errors, enforcing best research practices, and extracting data from published studies. In the upcoming academic year, I will be teaching quantitative research methods in psychology."
